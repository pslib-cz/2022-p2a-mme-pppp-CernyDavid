# ATOMSTACK X7 Pro drag chain holders  
The purpose of these chains is to prevent cables from interfering while the laser is working.  
There are 3 parts (one for X axis and Y axis and one that connects both).  
I used [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5506701) design by 737mechanic for the Y and XY parts and [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5274651) design for the X part.
