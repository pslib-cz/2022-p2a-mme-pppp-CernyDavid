# ATOMSTACK X7 Pro drag chain holders (3D print)
The purpose of these chains is to prevent cables from interfering while the laser is working. (The cable is going through the chains.) It can also hold air assist hose.  
There are 3 parts (one for X axis and Y axis and one that connects both). Everything is supposed to be 3D printed.  
I used [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5506701) design by 737mechanic for the Y and XY parts and [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5274651) design for the X part.  

## How to install
Y-axis: Just snap it onto the y-axis.

X & Y: Put it onto the lateral x-axis holder. First, you need to remove the U-shaped part on the back and then you can put it on. It fits very tightly and holds just fine, but you can secure it using screws.

X-axis: Remove the screws on the back of the laser head itself. Then, use those holes and screw in the holder. Unfortunately, the screws that are already inside are too short, so you need to get a longer ones. They should be at least 5mm longer.

## Chains
You need two drag chains, one for each axis. The holders are universal, you can use whatever chains you want, just make sure the holes for the screws are the same, so you can put everything together.  
You can either buy them or print them. Personally, I used [these](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2920060).  
Connect the chains with the holders using bolts and nuts. (diameter of the bolts: 3mm)
