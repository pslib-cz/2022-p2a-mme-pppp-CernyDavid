# ATOMSTACK X7 Pro drag chain holders (3D print)
The purpose of these chains is to prevent cables from interfering while the laser is working. (The cable is going through the chains.) It can also hold air assist hose.  
There are 3 parts (one for X axis and Y axis and one that connects both). Everything is supposed to be 3D printed.  
I used [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5506701) design by 737mechanic for the Y and XY parts and [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5274651) design for the X part.  

## How to install
### Y-axis
Just snap it onto the y-axis.

### X & Y
First, you need to remove the U-shaped part on the back.

Then, put the holder onto the lateral x-axis holder like this:

It fits very tightly and holds just fine, but you can secure it using screws.  
### X-axis  
Remove the screws on the back of the laser head itself.

Then, use those holes and screw in the holder like this:

Unfortunately, the screws that are already inside are too short, so you need to get a longer ones. They should be at least 5mm longer.

## Chains
You need two drag chains, one for each axis. The holders are universal, you can use whatever chains you want, just make sure the holes for the screws are the same, so you can put everything together. The holes are exactly 1 cm apart.  
You can either buy them or print them. Personally, I used [these](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2920060) (in this case, you need to make the holes for the screws yourself).  
Connect the chains with the holders using bolts and nuts. Diameter of the bolts should be 3 mm.  
If you use the same chains as me, you should be able to fit both the cable and the air hose through the chains.
